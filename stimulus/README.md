## NATVIEW Stimulus Code
This section contains MATLAB scripts for stimulus presentation. These scripts use various functions from [Psychtoolbox-3](http://psychtoolbox.org/) for a flickering checkerboard task, resting state task, and video task. Code has also been modified to work with the EyeLink 1000 Plus eye tracker by SR Research.

Users should also download the ```helpers.zip```, which contains MATLAB functions to send and receive triggers via parallel port. In addition, contains functions to use installed video players with MATLAB. Please also download [MPlayer](http://www.mplayerhq.hu/design7/news.html) and [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) for video playback.

***Installation Instructions***
1. Copy ```natview_stimuli_checkerboard.m``` and ```natview_stimuli_video.m``` to desired MATLAB path.
2. Unzip ```helpers.zip``` to desired MATLAB path.
3. Download MPlayer and FFmpeg. Install software to ```helpers``` directory.
4. In MATLAB add ```helpers``` directory to MATLAB path.
